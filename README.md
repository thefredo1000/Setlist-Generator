# Setlist-Generator
## This generator is to make your concert the best concert ever
In the "songs.xlsx" you will find a template to fill with your songs, with their artist, album and genres. When you run the code, a  ".pdf" file will appear to write a setlist that won't have songs from the same artist, albums or genres next to each other (or at least it could do). 

That's it :)
